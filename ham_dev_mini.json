therefore, for phase 1 rollout no eol interruptible/spot gtc is needed.  in phase 3 they may consider adding some interruptible products on line.  they do want an over the counter interruptible gtc, which will be prepared.  in any event, all eol physical gas will be sold online in phase 1 under the firm gtc (until masters are signed).  the phase 1 eol decision tree will then be if gisb master signed, up to 30 day firm gas under gisb, over 30 under firm gtc.  if firm master signed, all gas under firm master.\n\nany questions, please call.\n\ncordially,\nmary cook\n##### north america

t=\r\naub  sacramento, california, july 6 (bloomberg) -- california governor gray=\r\n davis's office released data on the state's purchases in the spot electric=\r\nity market -- information davis has been trying to keep secret -- through a=\r\n misdirected e-mail.  the e-mail, containing data on california's power pur=\r\nchases yesterday, was intended for members of the governor's staff, said da=\r\nvis spokesman steve maviglio. it was accidentally sent to some reporters on=\r\n the office's press list, he said.  davis is fighting disclosure of state p=\r\nower purchases, saying it would compromise negotiations for future contract=\r\ns. this week, davis appealed a state judge's order to release spot-market i=\r\nnvoices, purchase orders and confirmation sheets for power contracts signed=\r\n through june 27. the state is buying electricity on behalf of utilities, w=\r\nhich are burdened by debt.  ``it's an internal document,'' maviglio said of=\r\n the e-mail. ``we have a meeting every morning where we discuss issues of t=\r\nhe day.'' the e-mail contained minutes of today's meeting, he said.  accord=\r\ning to the e-mail, the state bought 283,000 megawatt- hours of electricity =\r\nfor $37.4 million yesterday. one megawatt- hour is enough electricity to li=\r\nght 750 typical california homes for an hour. prices ranged from $25 to $14=\r\n9.99 a megawatt-hour. maviglio said the information in the e-mail is accura=\r\nte.  power for next-day delivery during peak-use hours averaged $79.67 a me=\r\ngawatt-hour on the california-oregon border yesterday, according to bloombe=\r\nrg energy service. california paid an average of $132 on the spot market, a=\r\nccording to the e-mail. prices on the spot market tend to be higher than on=\r\n the day-ahead market.  the governor has proposed releasing data on spot-ma=\r\nrket purchases once a quarter, arguing that the state uses power-buying str=\r\nategies tailored to each season. lawyers for the media and republican legis=\r\nlators say state law requires disclosure of contracts within seven days aft=\r\ner they are signed.  =09\r\n\r\n\r\n", "message-id:
